## What's this?

This was a quick dashboard using streamlit for the HealthAI PoC demo. Specifically using TNO's TSG federated learning solution for the backend.
The code for that (backend) can be found here:

It's barebones, and again, just a demo / PoC. TODO: Authentication, proper coding practices, ... the works
